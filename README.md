# Online Graph Algorithms Visualization

Welcome to Graph Algo Visualizer! I built this application because I was absorbed by graph algorithms and I wished to visualize them.
I hope you enjoy playing around with this application as much as I had fun building it. You can access it via this link: <a href="https://luisalfonsopreciado.github.io/Graph-Algorithms-Visualization">Complete Project</a>

## Supported Algorithms

**Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm**

**A Star Search Algorithm**

**Greedy Best First Search**

**Breadth First Search**

**Depth First Search**

In addition, I implemented a recursive division maze generating algorithm.

## Other Features

- You can move the target and start node at your leisure.

- You can add walls by clicking on a valid cell.

- Once the animation is complete, you can move the target node to further visualize the algorithm.
