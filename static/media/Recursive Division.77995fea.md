### Recursive Division Maze Algorithm

The Recursive Division Algorithm is straightforward. Divide the maze in half with a wall, then remove one of the wall segments. This happens over and over on each new section of the maze, divide in half with a wall, and remove a wall segment. This continues until division would cut a cell into a faction.
